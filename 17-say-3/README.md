# Say Magnitudes

Write a program that will take a number from 0 to 999,999,999,999 and break it into chunks, adding the magnitude.

In other words, if the input to the program is `1234567890` then the output should be `'1 billion 234 million 567 thousand 890'`

The program must also report any values that are out of range.

## Extensions

If you solved the chunking using math, solve it again using strings.

If you solved it using strings, solve it using math.

If you solved it using strings by reversing it, solve it again by padding the string. And the inverse.

Refactor!
