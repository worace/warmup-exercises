# Wordy Arithmetic

Write a program that takes a word problem in the format:

> What is 5 plus 13?

> What is 7 minus 5?

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

> What is 25 divided by 5?

and returns the answer as an integer.

Use the tests to drive your solution by deleting the `skip` in one test at a time.
